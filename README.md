# SSSD

Structured Space State Diffusion Model for Time Series Imputation

## Instalation and Usage

To isntall the SSSD library with pip you can simply use

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/vladbizin/SSSD
```

Examples of training the model and imputing missing values are stored in the 'test_examples' folder.

## Documentation

docstrings and other documentation will be added
